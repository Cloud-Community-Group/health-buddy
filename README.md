# Features:

## Brain Tumor Detection:

- The brain tumor detection model uses MRI scans to detect the presence of tumors.

- Here you can upload brain’s MRI scan image and you will get a predicted result whether the person is having Brain Tumor or not.

- Here we have uploaded one image, and you can see it is saying **Brain Tumor Detected**.

## Eye Disease Detection:

- The Eye disease detector uses fundus images to detect abnormalities in the retina. We have four classifications for this.

1.  Normal
    
2.  Cataract
    
3.  Glaucoma
    
4.  Retina damage
    

- Here we can upload image to check whether a person has eye disease or not and if he has then which type of eye defect the person is having.

- Let's check by uploading an image having Cataract. As you can see it is saying **Cataract Detected**.

## Lung Disease Detector:

- Same goes with Lung Disease Detector, we can upload a image and it will predict the result.

## HealthBuddy Bot: 
### Dialogflow Integration with Open AI

***Dialogflow** is Google's offering that allows for easy integration of conversational interfaces into various applications. It supports multiple types of input and can respond through text or synthetic speech. This enables new and engaging ways for users to interact with a product.*

  

- We have integrated Google Cloud offering `Dialogflow` with `Open AI` to get accurate results and get responses only for healthcare related queries.

- You can see here, when we asked `“I am having fever”` it replied with a response. On the other hand when we asked something which is not related to healthcare, like `“How to download a youtube video”`, it replied `“Ask related to healthcare only”`.

- Also our bot can reply in different languages, here we asked in **Hindi** `“Mujhe sardi hai”`, which means I am having cold, and our bot replied in Hindi itself.

### Techstacks

The following technologies have been used to develop the Health Buddy web application:

- HTML/CSS/JS: The frontend of the application is built using HTML/CSS/JS.
- Google Maps API: The application uses the Google Maps API to fetch the location of the user and find doctors near them.
- Dialogflow: Dialogflow is used to build the chatbot and enable it to talk with the user.
- Flask: Flask is used to build the backend of the application.


## Future Goals
In the future, we plan to integrate more features and functionalities into Health Buddy. Some of our plans include:

- Integrate more disease detection algorithms: Currently, the application can detect brain tumor, retina problems, and lung cancer. We plan to add more detection algorithms to detect other diseases.
- Improve doctor recommendation system: We plan to integrate a more advanced recommendation system that suggests doctors based on the patient's condition and their specialization.
- Integrate telemedicine: We plan to add telemedicine functionalities that allow patients to consult with doctors online.
- Build a mobile app: We plan to build a mobile application for Health Buddy, which will make it easier for patients to access the services.
