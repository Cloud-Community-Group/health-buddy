# Health Buddy
The Health Buddy project is a web-based healthcare solution that uses machine learning models to detect brain tumors, retina defects, and lung diseases. The project's user interface is designed with HTML, CSS, and JS and has a sleek and modern appearance that is easy to use and navigate. Moreover, the project's chatbot made with Dialogflow is designed to answer health-related questions.

The Health Buddy project's appointment form is simple to fill out and will send an email confirmation to the patient once they have successfully scheduled an appointment. Additionally, the project includes a patient report analyzer that allows doctors to quickly and accurately analyze patient reports, helping them make informed decisions about their patients' health.

The machine learning models used in the Health Buddy project are trained on large datasets and use cutting-edge algorithms to achieve high accuracy rates. The brain tumor detection model uses MRI scans to detect the presence of tumors, while the retina defect detector uses fundus images to detect abnormalities in the retina. The lung disease detector uses chest X-rays to detect lung diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis.

In conclusion, the Health Buddy project is a significant breakthrough in the healthcare industry as it allows patients to receive early diagnosis and treatment for various health conditions, reducing the risk of complications and improving their overall health outcomes.

## Project Overview

Health Buddy is a web application that aims to assist patients in obtaining the necessary medical care for their needs. It provides several features, such as predicting brain tumor, detecting retina problems, lung cancer detection, finding nearby doctors, and taking appointments. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition, Health Buddy includes a chatbot that interacts with users and can suggest medical care for their needs. This chatbot is powered by Dialogflow, an AI-based natural language processing platform.

The project's future plans include integrating more advanced features, such as allowing users to track their medical history, providing personalized medical advice based on their data, and connecting with wearable health devices to monitor health in real-time.

The project is open to contributions from developers who wish to improve its functionality or add new features. To contribute, you can clone the repository using the git clone command, make changes to the code, and push the changes to the repository using git push command.

### Techstacks

The following technologies have been used to develop the Health Buddy web application:

- HTML/CSS/JS: The frontend of the application is built using HTML/CSS/JS.
- Google Maps API: The application uses the Google Maps API to fetch the location of the user and find doctors near them.
- Dialogflow: Dialogflow is used to build the chatbot and enable it to talk with the user.
- Flask: Flask is used to build the backend of the application.


## Future Goals
In the future, we plan to integrate more features and functionalities into Health Buddy. Some of our plans include:

- Integrate more disease detection algorithms: Currently, the application can detect brain tumor, retina problems, and lung cancer. We plan to add more detection algorithms to detect other diseases.
- Improve doctor recommendation system: We plan to integrate a more advanced recommendation system that suggests doctors based on the patient's condition and their specialization.
- Integrate telemedicine: We plan to add telemedicine functionalities that allow patients to consult with doctors online.
- Build a mobile app: We plan to build a mobile application for Health Buddy, which will make it easier for patients to access the services.
